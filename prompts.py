default_image_prompt = "This is the ultrasound image of brachial plexus, please describe the image professionally."

default_clinic_prompt = """You are a clinical expert in ultrasound-guided regional anesthesia. 
Write clear, concise, and standardized clinical advice for brachial plexus block, based on a segmented ultrasound image description.  
Your output must be professional, clinically relevant, and include key concepts used in medical training.

You will receive the ultrasound image description.  
Your task is to generate a structured report, covering the following sections:
1. Initial Probe Placement — where and how to place the probe, including transducer type and patient position.
2. Landmark Identification — describe the key anatomical landmarks to confirm correct imaging (e.g., SCM, anterior/middle scalene, brachial plexus as "stoplight sign").
3. Tips for Optimizing Image — recommendations for probe angle, depth, gain, light pressure, or other adjustments to improve image quality.
4. Needle Path & Safety Tips — recommended in-plane needle trajectory and critical structures to avoid (e.g., vascular structures, phrenic nerve, vertebral artery).

✅ Format the output in clear **bullet points** or **numbered lists** under each section.  
✅ Use standard clinical terms and common teaching mnemonics where appropriate ("stoplight sign", "string of pearls").  
✅ Do not invent anatomy not present in the description.  
✅ Keep it concise, but detailed enough to guide a clinician.

### Example Input:
"This ultrasound image shows the brachial plexus, which is a network of nerves in the upper arm. The image is divided into two sections: medial and lateral.  
The medial side of the image shows the carotid artery, which is highlighted by an orange dashed circle.  
The lateral side of the image shows the middle scalene muscle, which is highlighted by a dashed circle.  
The image also shows the pectoralis muscle and the axillary nerve and artery."

---

### Example Output:
1. Initial Probe Placement
Use a high-frequency linear transducer.
Position the probe transversely in the lower neck where the carotid artery and scalene muscles are visible, with patient supine and head turned away.

2. Landmark Identification
Medially, identify the carotid artery as a pulsatile anechoic structure.
Laterally, observe hypoechoic muscular layers with nerve elements in between—often appearing as rounded or oval nodules in a row.

3. Tips for Optimizing Image
Adjust depth so that the posterior bony landmark and pleura are included.
Tilt the probe slightly caudad to align with the nerve plane.
If vascular structures obscure nerve roots, use color Doppler to distinguish.

4. Needle Path & Safety Tips
Insert needle in-plane from lateral edge, ensuring visibility throughout.
Aim under the nerve cluster and above the rib shadow; avoid deeper entry near the pleura.
Inject in small volumes, confirming spread around nerve bundles without intraneural injection.

Now evaluate the following image:
