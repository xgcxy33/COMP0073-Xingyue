Once the artery has been identified, the transducer is moved slightly laterally across the neck. The goal is to identify the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the elements of the brachial plexus that is located between them. It is recommended to use the color Doppler to identify vascular structures and avoid them. The needle is then inserted in-plane toward the brachial plexus, typically in a lateral-to-medial direction, although a medial-to-lateral needle orientation can also be used if there is no room for the former. The needle should always be aimed in between the roots instead of directly at them in order to minimize the risk of accidental nerve injury. As the needle passes through the prevertebral fascia, a certain “pop” is often appreciated. When nerve stimulation is used (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec), the entrance of the needle in the interscalene groove is often associated with a motor response of the shoulder, arm, or forearm as another confirmation of proper needle placement. After careful aspiration to rule out intravascular needle placement, 1–2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to verify proper needle placement. It is necessary to ensure that high resistance to injection is absent to decrease the risk of intrafascicular injection. Injection of several milliliters of local anesthetic often displaces the brachial plexus away from the needle. Additional advancement of the needle 1–2 mm toward the brachial plexus may be beneficial to ensure the proper spread of the local anesthetic .

This block can be performed with the patient in the supine, semi-sitting (our favorite), or slight oblique position, with the patient’s head turned away from the side to be blocked. When possible, asking the patient to reach for the ipsilateral knee will depress the clavicle slightly and allow better access to the structures of the anterolateral neck. Also, a slight elevation of the head of the bed is often more comfortable for the patient and allows for better drainage and less prominence of the neck veins (Figure 30-1). Adherence to strict anatomic landmarks is of lesser importance for the ultrasound-guided `` block than for the surface anatomy techniques. However, knowledge of the underlying anatomy and the position of the brachial plexus in relation to the subclavian artery, first rib, and pleura are important for the success and safety of the technique.

The transducer is tilted caudally to obtain a cross-sectional view of the subclavian artery (Figures 30-6). The brachial plexus is seen as a collection of hypoechoic oval structures lateral and superficial to the artery.",
            "clinic_output": "Clinical Advice for Brachial Plexus Block:\n\n**Initial Probe Placement**\n\n1. Transducer Type: High-frequency linear (10-15 MHz)\n2. Patient Position: Supine, head turned 30-45 degrees contralaterally, shoulder depressed\n3. Probe Placement: Transversely above the clavicle\n4. Tilt: Slight caudad tilt\n\n**Landmark Identification**\n\n1. **BP (Brachial Plexus)**: Hyperechoic structure visualized as a group of hypoechoic circles (string of pearls sign)\n2. **ASM (Anterior Superior Mesenteric Nerve)**: A hypoechoic structure located near the brachial plexus\n3. **MSM (Medial Superior Mesenteric Nerve)**: Another hypoechoic structure situated in the region\n\n**Tips for Optimizing Image**\n\n1. Adjust the depth to 2-4 cm\n2. Optimize the gain to enhance visualization of the brachial plexus and surrounding structures\n3. Apply slight probe pressure and adjust the tilt if necessary\n4. Use Doppler to identify nearby vessels (e.g., subclavian artery)\n\n**Needle Path & Safety Tips**\n\n1. Needle Approach: In-plane from lateral to medial\n2. Target Location: Aim for the brachial plexus (BP) at the level of the ASM and MSM\n3. Structures to Avoid: Pleura, subclavian artery (if visualized), and the phrenic nerve\n4. Injection Technique: Inject 1-2 mL aliquots under real-time ultrasound guidance, ensuring proper spread around the brachial plexus"
