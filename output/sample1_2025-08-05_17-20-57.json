            "literature": "The supine patient has the face turned towards the contralateral shoulder (Fig. 1). The pillow underneath the head is carefully positioned to provide adequate space for the probe and the needle without compromising asepsis. The operator sits on the same side of the block with the ultrasound machine placed on the opposite side of the patient trolley, so that the eye, needle, probe, and screen are all aligned. A sterile high-frequency (10–13 MHz) probe is used to scan the neck transversely between the level of cricoid cartilage and supraclavicular fossa until an optimal view of the hypoechoic round images of C5 and 6 nerve roots or upper trunk is obtained (Fig. 2). A 50-mm block needle is then carefully inserted either parallel (in-plane from lateral to medial) or perpendicular (out-of-plane) to the probe. We recommend an in-plane approach for single-shot nerve blocks (Video 1, Fig. 2), but an out-of-plane approach (cranial to caudal) may be useful for siting a catheter between the scalene muscles for continuous postoperative infusion analgesia. The plexus is enclosed within an interscalene fascial sheath and the needle is advanced carefully, lateral to medial, through scalenus medius muscle, with the needle shaft continuously visualized, until the fascial sheath overlying the plexus, is contacted. There remains some debate as to whether this fascia should be routinely pierced or the injection performed at this point, reducing chances of needle to nerve contact. We tend to puncture the fascia to obtain spread medial and lateral to the plexus, but confined within the interscalene fascial sheath, to attempt to minimize phrenic nerve blockade. If performed in this way, care must be taken to continually visualize the needle tip and aim between, rather than targeting nerve roots, to avoid nerve contact or intraneural injection. Studies have determined the minimum effective local anaesthetic volume for postoperative shoulder analgesia to be as little as 0.9 ml with ultrasound when compared with 5.4 ml with nerve stimulation.3 We routinely use 8–10 ml of ropivacaine 2 mg ml−1 when using the block for postoperative analgesia in combination with GA, but will use larger volumes (15–20 ml) of a higher concentration to guarantee an effective anaesthetic block for awake surgery.",

Transducer is placed 2-3cm superior to the midpoint of the clavicle, or slightly superior to the external jugular vein if it can be appreciated. Two techniques can be used to identify the cords for the interscalene block. 1) The carotid artery can be identified deep to the sternocleidomastoid, then the probe can be slid posteriorly until a stack of cords is seen in between the anterior and middle scalenes. 2) Identify the subclavian artery in the supraclavicular fossa and trace the brachial plexus up into the interscalene space.Once this view is obtained, an in-plane approach should be used.

            "literature": "Ideally, the patient should be placed supine with the head of the bed elevated to approximately 30 degrees. A towel or bump can be placed under the affected shoulder to rotate the thorax so that the needle can be advanced in at a flat angle (this allows for better needle visualization). With the patient’s head turned away from the affected side, place a high-frequency linear transducer on the neck lateral to the cricoid cartilage. For novice sonographers who are unfamiliar with the regional anatomy of the brachial plexus, we recommend first to identify the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Slide the transducer lateral until the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be seen lying superficially to the anterior scalene muscle. By sliding the transducer just laterally, the interscalene groove can be identified between the anterior and middle scalene by the characteristic traffic light appearance of the C5-C7 nerve roots lying vertically between the muscle bodies. If possible, we recommend placing color Doppler over the hypoechoic circular nerve roots to ensure that they are not vasculature. After identifying the C5-C7 nerve roots and other relevant anatomical structures, a small skin wheal should be placed approximately 1 cm lateral to the probe. Using the skin wheel as the point of entry, a 21 to 23 gauge 1 ½ inch block needle should be advanced under ultrasound guidance using an in-plane technique. The needle tip is then advanced just above the middle scalene muscle. The goal is to place anesthetic just under the prevertebral fascia that overlays the superficial border of the middle scalene muscle. Ideally, the anechoic fluid will spread down the interscalene groove in between the brachial plexus and the middle scalene muscle, but this may not always be possible. When the needle tip is appropriately positioned, a local anesthetic will spread along the fascial plane, separating the nerve roots from the middle scalene. (fig 11 and 12) Often, small needle tip adjustments are needed to achieve anesthetic spread along the fascial plane.",

            "literature": "With the patient in the proper position, the skin is disinfected and the transducer is positioned in the transverse plane to identify the carotid artery. Once the artery has been identified, the transducer is moved slightly laterally across the neck. The goal is to identify the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the elements of the brachial plexus that is located between them. It is recommended to use the color Doppler to identify vascular structures and avoid them. The needle is then inserted in-plane toward the brachial plexus, typically in a lateral-to-medial direction (Figure 6), although a medial-to-lateral needle orientation can also be used if there is no room for the former. The needle should always be aimed in between the roots instead of directly at them in order to minimize the risk of accidental nerve injury. As the needle passes through the prevertebral fascia, a certain “pop” is often appreciated. When nerve stimulation is used (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec), the entrance of the needle in the interscalene groove is often associated with a motor response of the shoulder, arm, or forearm as another confirmation of proper needle placement. After careful aspiration to rule out intravascular needle placement, 1–2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to verify proper needle placement (Figure 7-A). It is necessary to ensure that high resistance to injection is absent to decrease the risk of intrafascicular injection. Injection of several milliliters of local anesthetic often displaces the brachial plexus away from the needle. Additional advancement of the needle 1–2 mm toward the brachial plexus may be beneficial to ensure the proper spread of the local anesthetic. When injection of the local anesthetic does not appear to result in a spread around the brachial plexus, additional needle repositioning and injections may be necessary.",
