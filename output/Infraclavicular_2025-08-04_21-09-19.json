            "literature": "The patient is placed in the supine position with the head turned towards the opposite shoulder. The operator sits at the head of the patient with the ultrasound machine positioned facing him, next to the patient's trunk on the same side as the block, to maintain the straight line from eye to screen in a comfortable position for the operator. Although a linear probe can be used, a small high-frequency curved-array probe, if available, is recommended as this provides a broader view at the depth of 4–6 cm which may be required for this approach (Video 3, Fig. 4). In addition, it facilitates in-plane needle placement below a prominent clavicle. We routinely use a small 9–3 MHz curved-array probe with an 80 mm, 22 g block needle placed immediately below the clavicle, medial to the coracoid process, to get an optimal short-axis view in a para-sagittal plane. Typically, the axillary artery is surrounded by the three hyperechoic round cords (lateral, posterior, and medial) of the plexus, named after their anatomical position with respect to the axillary artery. An ultrasound enhancement artifact below the artery can frequently be confused with the posterior cord. This phenomenon is seen when tissues appear more echogenic and bright when visualized through a fluid-filled structure such as blood vessels. The posterior cord is more commonly visualized lying below the lateral cord. (Fig. 4) The axillary vein can be seen lying anatomically medial to the axillary artery. The needle is inserted in-plane, under the clavicle (above the probe) and the local anaesthetic is placed postero-lateral to the axillary artery (8 o’clock position) ensuring a good spread around the artery (double–bubble sign). The needle may have to be advanced slightly towards a ‘6 o’clock’ position to ensure spread below and around the artery towards the medial cord. Bowens et al.8 demonstrated a 96% success rate when the posterior cord (6 o'clock position) was targeted during the block and all patients had a pain score ≤3 in the postoperative period. Using ultrasound-guidance has improved the efficacy of this technique, although the minimum effective local anaesthetic volume in 90% patients remains ∼35 ml.",

            "literature": "Any position that allows for the comfortable placement of the ultrasound transducer and needle advancement is appropriate. The nerve block is typically performed with the patient in the supine position with the head turned away from the side to be blocked (Figure 4). The arm is abducted to 90 degrees and the elbow flexed. This maneuver raises the clavicle, reduces the depth from the skin to the plexus, and substantially facilitates visualization of the pectoralis muscles as well as the cords of the brachial plexus and the needle. The coracoid process is an important landmark and can be easily identified by palpating the bony prominence just medial to the shoulder while the arm is elevated and lowered. As the arm is lowered, the coracoid process meets the fingers of the palpating hand. Scanning usually begins just medial to the coracoid process and inferior to the clavicle. Keeping the probe in a parasagittal plane, scanning medially and laterally allows the chest wall and pleura to be located (Figure 5). The nerve block should be performed with the probe lateral to the pleura in order to minimize the risk of pneumothorax. With the patient in the proper position, the skin is disinfected and the transducer is positioned in the parasagittal plane to identify the axillary artery (see Figure 3 and 4). This may require adjustment of the depth, depending on the thickness of the patient’s chest wall musculature. The axillary artery is typically seen between 3 and 5 cm. Once the artery has been identified, an attempt is made to identify the hyperechoic cords of the brachial plexus and their corresponding positions relative to the artery, although these may not always be identifiable. Fortunately, visualization of the cords are not necessary for successful block. The needle is inserted in-plane from the cephalad end of the probe, with the insertion point just inferior to the clavicle (see Figure 4). The needle is aimed toward the posterior aspect of the axillary artery and passes through the pectoralis major and minor muscles. If nerve stimulation is used concurrently (0.5–0.8 mA, 0.1 msec), the first motor response is often from the lateral cord (either elbow flexion or finger flexion). As the needle is advanced farther beneath the artery, a posterior cord motor response may appear (finger and wrist extension). After careful aspiration, 1–2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to confirm proper needle placement and spread. The injectate should spread cephalad and caudad to cover the lateral and medial cords, respectively (Figure 6).",

            "literature": "Place the transducer below the clavicle, medial to the coracoid process with the probe positioned in a parasagittal fashion (Figure 6). Identify the axillary artery, which lies posterior to the pectoralis major and minor muscles. The axillary artery is typically located at a depth of 3 to 4.5 cm. It is seen as a dark, round, pulsating structure with a hyperechoic wall (Figure 3). The axillary vein usually lies beside the artery (medially and inferiorly), and it very easily collapses with compression. Hence, additional attention should be paid to the vein to prevent inadvertent puncture of the vessel. A combination of 2-dimensional and colour Doppler will allow identification of arterial and venous anatomy and confirm their position. Be mindful that the brachial plexus in the infraclavicular region is deeper compared with other sites (4 cm), and the location of the cords around the axillary artery can vary significantly (Figure 2). The axillary artery is surrounded by 3 hyperechoic circular cords of the brachial plexus: the lateral, posterior, and medial cords. These have a honeycomb appearance. The lateral cord generally lies superior (cranial) to the axillary artery, and the posterior and medial cords lie posteriorly and inferiorly (cephalad) to the axillary artery, respectively (Figures 3 and 4). Place 2 mL of 1% to 2% lidocaine subcutaneously prior to placement of the block needle. Reconfirm the sonoanatomy with US and anchor the probe by placing your hand on the patient’s torso. Using an in-plane needle technique, from cephalad to caudad, visualise the needle throughout the performance of the block. Place the needle inferior to the clavicle and direct the needle inferiorly toward the posterior aspect of the axillary artery. The skin, subcutaneous tissue, pectoralis major, and pectoralis minor are penetrated en route toward the infraclavicular plexus (Figure 7). The angle of approach is very acute, which requires the direction of the needle to be quite steep. This will make concurrent visualisation of the needle and the surrounding anatomy challenging. A ‘‘heel-in’’ manoeuvre (as described below) may help to improve the view and allow more space on the skin below the clavicle to insert the needle (Figure 9). As the needle is advanced under US guidance, with a nerve stimulator connected with a stimulation current of 0.5 mA to 1 mA at 0.1 seconds, the lateral cord motor response will be manifested as elbow or finger flexion. Reducing the stimulating current to 0.2 mA with no motor manifestations of lateral cord response would deem it safe to begin deposition of LA in this location.",

We use a technique in which the arm is abducted 110°, externally rotated and the elbow is flexed 90°. The puncture is made at the apex of the delto-pectoral groove in the sagittal plane (Fig. 1). We call this the medial infraclavicular technique (MIT). We use this proximal approach because the cords are grouped close together, superior to the axillary artery, at this location in the plexus (Fig. 2) and they may lie closer to the skin. As one moves distally along the plexus, the medial cord comes to lie between the axillary artery and vein where it may be more difficult to block (Fig 3, Fig 4).

The transducer is placed in a parasagittal position below the clavicle on the medial aspect of the coracoid process (Figure 9.3). Depending on the size and body habitus of the child, a probe with a short linear length such as 25 mm may be required. Some adjustment of the probe in multiple planes may be necessary to achieve a satisfactory view of the artery and the surrounding cords. Abduction of the arm to 90 degrees may be helpful by moving the acromioclavicular junction superiorly. In younger or thin children a high frequency linear probe may be sufficient for visualization of the infraclavicular fossa while a lower frequency curved array probe may be necessary in larger children and adolescents to visualize a deeper infraclavicular fossa. Color Doppler may be useful to verify the position of the axillary artery and vein. The lateral cord is seen as a hyperechoic structure as is the posterior cord, which can be seen posterior to the axillary artery at the 6 o’clock position. The medial cord may be more difficult to visualize but the injection of 1–2 ml of LA anterior to the artery may improve its localization. For single injection a 22-gauge needle can be used and the length of needle (50–100 mm) can be chosen based on the child’s size and plexus depth. A 25 mm BP needle may be sufficient in infants and small children while a 100 mm BP needle may be required to reach the infraclavicular fossa in adolescents. The needle is then inserted between the coracoid process and the superior portion of the ultrasound probe. The needle is advanced in-plane through the pectoralis major and minor muscles (Figure 9.4). Because of the steep needle angle required to reach the infraclavicular BP, the needle image may not be very clear so care must be taken to monitor tissue displacement as the needle is advanced in an effort to avoid puncturing the artery. The LA is injected in small 3–5 ml increments around the cords ensuring that there is adequate perivascular spread of the LA, especially medially and laterally around the artery. Current recommended volumes are 0.5 ml/kg of 0.2% ropivacaine or 0.25% bupivacaine, although these volumes may reduce with the increasing experience with ultrasound to guide LA deposition for this block.",

The artery is on the cephalad side of the vein, and is rounder and less compressible than the vein. If more than two vessels are seen, slide probe medially, simplifying the image as branches of vessels rejoin the major trunks.

The goal is to place the needle just alongside the cephalad portion of the artery. Injection of local anesthetic can then commence in small increments (with frequent aspiration to ensure no intravascular placement). It is very important to pay attention to the spread of the local anesthetic, since, as mentioned previously, there are fascial divisions described in this portion of the plexus inhibiting full spread from a single injection site. If full spread of the local anesthetic around the artery is not seen surrounding it like a doughnut (except for the most superficial side of the artery), reposition the needle under direct visualization. Usually one repositioning is enough to complete the spread.

The injectate should appear to spread to either sides of the artery, and the artery is lifted superficially.",
            "clinic_output": "Initial Probe Placement:\n1. Transducer Type: High-frequency linear array (10-15 MHz)\n2. Patient Position: Supine, head turned 30-45 degrees contralaterally, shoulder depressed\n3. Probe Placement: Transversely above clavicle\n4. Tilt: Slight caudad tilt\n\nLandmark Identification:\n1. Axillary Artery (AA): Hyperechoic structure\n2. Axillary Vein (AV): Anechoic structure\n3. Posterior Cord (PC): Hyperechoic structure\n4. Lateral Cord (LC): Hyperechoic structure\n5. Posterior Cord (PMC): Hyperechoic structure\n\nTips for Optimizing Image:\n1. Depth adjustment: 2-4 cm\n2. Gain adjustment: 50 dB\n3. Probe pressure adjustment: Apply slight pressure to improve image quality\n4. Tilt adjustment: Slight caudad tilt\n5. Use Doppler to aid in identifying vessels (AA and AV)\n\nNeedle Path & Safety Tips:\n1. Needle Approach: In-plane, lateral-to-medial\n2. Target Location: Lateral to the axillary artery (AA)\n3. Structures to avoid: Pleura, axillary artery (AA), axillary vein (AV), phrenic nerve\n4. Injection technique: Inject 1-2 mL aliquots under real-time ultrasound guidance.  Note: This clinical advice is specific to the described ultrasound image. Always assess individual patient anatomy and adjust accordingly."

            "literature": "Select a linear high-frequency probe. Adjust gain, focus and depth 3–4 cm.Turn the orientation mark on the probe cranially. Place the probe below the clavicle, medial to the coracoid process in the parasagittal plane. Locate the black, pulsatile axillary artery (AA) and align it to the centre of the monitor. Seeing AA as a clock face the lateral cord is located at nine o’clock, the posterior cord at six o’clock and the medial cord at two o’clock. Often the cords are not sonographically visible. Insert the needle below the clavicle and advance it in-plane aiming periarterially at seven o’clock. Empty the needle of air by injecting 1/2 mL local anaesthetic subcutaneously. Avoid piercing any vessels or nerves. The endpoint of injection is periarterially from two o’clock to ten o’clock. Reposition the needle tip as necessary to reach the endpoint",
            "clinic_output": "Initial Probe Placement:\n1. Use a high-frequency linear transducer, such as a 10-15 MHz linear probe.\n2. Place the patient in a supine position with their head turned 30-45 degrees contralaterally and their shoulder depressed.\n3. Position the transducer transversely above the clavicle with a slight caudad tilt.\n\nLandmark Identification:\n1. Identify the hyperechoic (bright) appearance of the clavicle.\n2. Visualize the brachial plexus as a group of hypoechoic (darker) structures posterior to the clavicle.\n3. Note the presence of the subclavian artery, which appears as an anechoic (black) structure.\n4. Identify the pleura, which can be seen as a hyperechoic linear structure deep to the brachial plexus.\n\nTips for Optimizing Image:\n1. Adjust the depth of the ultrasound image to 2-4 cm to ensure optimal visualization of the brachial plexus.\n2. Optimize the gain settings to enhance the differentiation between different tissues.\n3. Apply slight pressure with the transducer to improve image quality.\n4. Use Doppler ultrasound if available to help identify vessels.\n\nNeedle Path & Safety Tips:\n1. Insert the needle in-plane from a lateral-to-medial direction.\n2. Target the brachial plexus at a location posterior to the clavicle.\n3. Avoid puncturing the pleura or subclavian artery.\n4. Use real-time ultrasound guidance and inject 1-2 mL aliquots of local anesthetic solution."
