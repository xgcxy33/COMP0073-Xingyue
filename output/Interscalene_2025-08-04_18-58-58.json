The pillow underneath the head is carefully positioned to provide adequate space for the probe and the needle without compromising asepsis. The operator sits on the same side of the block with the ultrasound machine placed on the opposite side of the patient trolley, so that the eye, needle, probe, and screen are all aligned. A sterile high-frequency (10–13 MHz) probe is used to scan the neck transversely between the level of cricoid cartilage and supraclavicular fossa until an optimal view of the hypoechoic round images of C5 and 6 nerve roots or upper trunk is obtained (Fig. 2). A 50-mm block needle is then carefully inserted either parallel (in-plane from lateral to medial) or perpendicular (out-of-plane) to the probe. We recommend an in-plane approach for single-shot nerve blocks (Video 1, Fig. 2), but an out-of-plane approach (cranial to caudal) may be useful for siting a catheter between the scalene muscles for continuous postoperative infusion analgesia. The plexus is enclosed within an interscalene fascial sheath and the needle is advanced carefully, lateral to medial, through scalenus medius muscle, with the needle shaft continuously visualized, until the fascial sheath overlying the plexus, is contacted. There remains some debate as to whether this fascia should be routinely pierced or the injection performed at this point, reducing chances of needle to nerve contact. We tend to puncture the fascia to obtain spread medial and lateral to the plexus, but confined within the interscalene fascial sheath, to attempt to minimize phrenic nerve blockade. If performed in this way, care must be taken to continually visualize the needle tip and aim between, rather than targeting nerve roots, to avoid nerve contact or intraneural injection. Studies have determined the minimum effective local anaesthetic volume for postoperative shoulder analgesia to be as little as 0.9 ml with ultrasound when compared with 5.4 ml with nerve stimulation.3 We routinely use 8–10 ml of ropivacaine 2 mg ml−1 when using the block for postoperative analgesia in combination with GA, but will use larger volumes (15–20 ml) of a higher concentration to guarantee an effective anaesthetic block for awake surgery.",

A towel or bump can be placed under the affected shoulder to rotate the thorax so that the needle can be advanced in at a flat angle (this allows for better needle visualization). With the patient’s head turned away from the affected side, place a high-frequency linear transducer on the neck lateral to the cricoid cartilage. For novice sonographers who are unfamiliar with the regional anatomy of the brachial plexus, we recommend first to identify the carotid artery and internal jugular vein. Slide the transducer lateral until the sternocleidomastoid muscle can be seen lying superficially to the anterior scalene muscle. By sliding the transducer just laterally, the interscalene groove can be identified between the anterior and middle scalene by the characteristic traffic light appearance of the C5-C7 nerve roots lying vertically between the muscle bodies. If possible, we recommend placing color Doppler over the hypoechoic circular nerve roots to ensure that they are not vasculature. After identifying the C5-C7 nerve roots and other relevant anatomical structures, a small skin wheal should be placed approximately 1 cm lateral to the probe. Using the skin wheel as the point of entry, a 21 to 23 gauge 1 ½ inch block needle should be advanced under ultrasound guidance using an in-plane technique. The needle tip is then advanced just above the middle scalene muscle. The goal is to place anesthetic just under the prevertebral fascia that overlays the superficial border of the middle scalene muscle. Ideally, the anechoic fluid will spread down the interscalene groove in between the brachial plexus and the middle scalene muscle, but this may not always be possible. When the needle tip is appropriately positioned, a local anesthetic will spread along the fascial plane, separating the nerve roots from the middle scalene. (fig 11 and 12) Often, small needle tip adjustments are needed to achieve anesthetic spread along the fascial plane.",

            "literature": "With the patient in the proper position, the skin is disinfected and the transducer is positioned in the transverse plane to identify the carotid artery. Once the artery has been identified, the transducer is moved slightly laterally across the neck. The goal is to identify the anterior and middle scalene muscles and the elements of the brachial plexus that is located between them. It is recommended to use the color Doppler to identify vascular structures and avoid them. The needle is then inserted in-plane toward the brachial plexus, typically in a lateral-to-medial direction (Figure 6), although a medial-to-lateral needle orientation can also be used if there is no room for the former. The needle should always be aimed in between the roots instead of directly at them in order to minimize the risk of accidental nerve injury. As the needle passes through the prevertebral fascia, a certain “pop” is often appreciated. When nerve stimulation is used (0.5 mA, 0.1 msec), the entrance of the needle in the interscalene groove is often associated with a motor response of the shoulder, arm, or forearm as another confirmation of proper needle placement. After careful aspiration to rule out intravascular needle placement, 1–2 mL of local anesthetic is injected to verify proper needle placement (Figure 7-A). It is necessary to ensure that high resistance to injection is absent to decrease the risk of intrafascicular injection. Injection of several milliliters of local anesthetic often displaces the brachial plexus away from the needle. Additional advancement of the needle 1–2 mm toward the brachial plexus may be beneficial to ensure the proper spread of the local anesthetic. When injection of the local anesthetic does not appear to result in a spread around the brachial plexus, additional needle repositioning and injections may be necessary.",

The operator can position themselves at the patient’s side or at the head of the bed. Proper bed height and ergonomics are key to the safe conduct of regional anaesthesia.Gain intravenous access, apply standard monitoring, and perform institutional preprocedural safety checklist (see Table 3). Position the patient and perform skin preparation of the neck and supraclavicular area with chlorhexidine/alcohol before applying sterile drapes and covering the transducer with a sterile cover. Position the transducer in the supraclavicular fossa just cephalad and parallel to the clavicle to identify the subclavian artery, first rib, lung pleura and the brachial plexus trunks. Using the ‘‘traceback’’ method, follow the nerve trunks back up to the interscalene groove by sliding the transducer cephalad while maintaining visualization of the plexus. Once the brachial plexus nerve roots have been identified in the interscalene groove, confirm the cervical level based on transverse process anatomy. Use colour Doppler to identify vascular structures, paying specific attention to avoid the vertebral artery and the transverse cervical artery. When visualizing the ‘‘stoplight sign,’’ the C6 nerve root’s fascicles are correctly identified by tracing the nerve root proximal to its bifurcation where the nerve exits the intervertebral foramen. Confirm appropriate probe position before attempting needle puncture. The probe should be oriented transversely across the lateral neck, overlying the sternocleidomastoid and scalene muscles, at approximately the level of the cricoid cartilage. Block Conduct—Periplexus Interscalene Block Confirm the identity of critical landmarks: AS, MS, and the C5 and C6 roots within the interscalene groove. Infiltrate the skin with 1 to 3 mL of local anaesthetic. Advance the block needle in plane through skin and MS towards the C5 and C6 roots in the interscalene groove (Figure 9). As the needle traverses MS, be careful to avoid injuring the long thoracic and dorsal scapular nerves. Advance the needle through the MS and stop at the border of its fascial layer with the hyperechoic fascia covering the brachial plexus. A subtle ‘‘pop’’ sensation may be appreciated when the needle tip enters the interscalene groove. The needle tip does not need to pierce the brachial plexus sheath (periplexus approach). This approach is advised to reduce the risk of nerve injury. Aspirate to rule out an intravascular needle position and inject 1 mL of saline or 5% dextrose to confirm deposition between the fascial layers. To avoid intraneural injection, only inject with low pressures, observe the nerve roots to rule out nerve expansion (which indicates intraneural injection), and communicate with the patient to rule out paresthesias during needle advancement. If the injectate spreads posteriorly along the needle tract within MS, advance another 1 to 2 mm, being careful to avoid piercing the nerve roots with the needle. Correct injectate deposition will appear on ultrasound as the plexus being pushed medially with hypoechoic spread adjacent to the nerve roots.",

            "clinic_output": "Initial Probe Placement\n1. Transducer type: High-frequency linear (10-15 MHz)\n2. Patient position: Supine, head turned 30-45 degrees contralaterally, shoulder depressed\n3. Probe placement: Transversely above clavicle\n4. Tilt: Slight caudad tilt\n\nLandmark Identification\n1. Anterior Scalene Muscle (AS): Hyperechoic structure located anteriorly\n2. Middle Scalene Muscle (MS): Hyperechoic structure situated medially\n3. Sternocleidomastoid Muscle (SCM): Hyperechoic structure positioned laterally\n4. Brachial Plexus Junction (BPJ): Central structure connecting the muscles and nerves\n\nTips for Optimizing Image\n1. Adjust depth: 2-4 cm\n2. Adjust gain: Optimize to visualize nerves and surrounding musculature\n3. Apply slight pressure with the probe\n4. Use Doppler to identify vessels\n\nNeedle Path & Safety Tips\n1. Needle approach: In-plane, lateral-to-medial\n2. Target location: At the BPJ, between the AS and MS\n3. Structures to avoid: Pleura, arteries/veins, phrenic nerve\n4. Injection technique: Inject 1-2 mL aliquots under real-time ultrasound"
