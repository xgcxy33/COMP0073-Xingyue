The operator either sits in front of the exposed axilla in a conventional position with the machine placed beside the patient's head on the operative side, or may sit beside the head facing the feet, for an in-plane approach. A high-frequency linear probe is placed transversely on the proximal humerus to obtain an optimal short-axis view of the various vascular and neural structures of the axilla/proximal humerus. The axillary artery is easily visualized and the nerves are generally seen as hyperechoic round structures surrounding this, although individual anatomy can be very variable (Fig. 5). Ay et al.9 have demonstrated that connective tissue can surround each nerve and this may explain the improved success rate with multiple injections to block all the nerves and improve the circumferential spread of local anaesthetic. The axillary vein most commonly lies medial to the artery between the 12 and 2 o\u2019clock position, although additional vessels are common, particularly inferior to the artery in the 6 o\u2019clock position. The musculocutaneous nerve usually leaves the plexus proximally and in the axilla tends to lie in the fascial plane separating coracobrachialis and short head of biceps muscles. The median nerve lies supero-laterally and close to the artery (9\u201312 o'clock position). The ulnar nerve is usually located infero-medially beneath the axillary vein, often a discrete distance from the artery when compared with the median. The radial nerve is often the hardest to visualize, but it consistently lies between 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock position in relation to the artery. Injecting a small increment of local anaesthetic in this area can help enhance the nerve visibility. Alternatively, injection can be made at the 5\u20136 o'clock position close to the artery in the plane above the conjoint tendon covering the teres major muscle. Tracing the nerves from more distal positions to their final locations relative to the artery can also help confirm location of the terminal nerves. A 50-mm needle is usually preferred for an out-of-plane technique (similar approach to conventional nerve stimulation technique), whereas an 80-mm needle may be useful for an in-plane technique in the larger arm (Video 4, Fig. 5). The latter approach allows visualization of the needle tip and the shaft, whereas an out-of-plane technique will only show a hyperechoic dot and movement of surrounding tissue. Hydro-dissection or small increments of local anaesthetic are often therefore needed to confirm needle tip location. Recent studies have demonstrated shorter performance time and fewer needle passes with a perivascular technique without compromising efficacy.10 However, in our clinical practice, we use multiple perineural injections of local anaesthetic volume varying between 20 and 30 ml. Gonzalez et al.11 demonstrated that the minimum effective volume to block the musculocutaneous nerve is 5.5 ml with a further 23.5 ml for perivascular injection to block the remaining nerves in 90% of patients, although there is evidence of a successful block with as little as 1\u20132 ml per nerve", "clinic_output": "1. Choose a linear transducer and place it at the lateral neck, aligning with the indicated direction, and adjust the angle slightly medially. 2. Identify the median nerve in the center of the image and the anterior nerve towards the top as key landmarks. 3. Adjust the depth and gain to clearly visualize the brachial plexus structures. 4. Advance the needle in-plane from lateral to medial towards the median nerve, ensuring continuous visualization of the needle tip. 5. Take precautions to avoid the brachial artery located towards the right side of the image."}, {"image_path": "./images/Axillary/31.png", "literature": "An abduction of the arm to 90 degrees is necessary to allow for transducer placement and needle advancement. Care should be taken not to over-abduct the arm, as this may cause patient discomfort as well as traction on the brachial plexus, making it theoretically more vulnerable to injury by needle or injection. The pectoralis major muscle is palpated as it inserts onto the humerus, and the transducer is placed on the skin immediately distal to that point, perpendicular to the axis of the arm. The starting point should have the transducer overlying both the biceps and triceps muscles (ie, on the medial aspect of the arm). Sliding the transducer proximally will bring the axillary artery, the conjoint tendon and the terminal branches of the brachial plexus into view, if not readily apparent. The skin is disinfected and the transducer is positioned in the short axis orientation to identify the axillary artery about 1\u20133 cm from the skin surface. Once the artery is identified, an attempt is made to identify the hyperechoic median, ulnar, and radial nerves. However, these may not always be well visualized with ultrasound. Frequently present, an acoustic enhancement artifact deep to the artery is often misinterpreted as the radial nerve. Prescanning should also reveal the position of the musculocutaneous nerve, in the plane between the coracobrachialis and biceps muscles or within either of the muscles (a slight proximal-distal movement of the transducer is often required to bring this nerve into view) .The needle is inserted in-plane from the anterior aspect and directed toward the posterior aspect of the axillary artery. Because nerves and vessels are positioned closely together in the neurovascular bundle by adjacent musculature, advancement of the needle may require careful hydrodissection with a small amount of local anesthetic or other injectates. This technique involves the injection of 0.5\u20132 mL, indicating the plane in which the needle tip is located.", "clinic_output": "1.
